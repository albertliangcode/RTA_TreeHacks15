Why Quintesstion? 
Lectures are an old, inefficient way to present material to students. Unfortunately, the larger the class is, the more often professors have to use lectures as the primary method of interacting with their students. Students also feel more nervous about interrupting the flow of lecture, worried that they will ask stop the class only to ask a "dumb question",

Quintesstion takes care of both of these problems. This accessible web app allows professors to easily view and respond to students' questions in real time. Because posts are anonymous, students can ask the questions they need to ask without identifying themselves or interrupting lecture. With Quintesstion supporting both professors and students, lectures become much more direct and effective as a teaching strategy.
